        <h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<h2 id="entity">Entity</h2>
<p>An entity is an object in the business logic of your application. It is not 
accessible to the outside world.</p>
<h2 id="resource">Resource</h2>
<p>A resource is a data structure that is exposed to the outside world. 
It is always built from one (or multiple) entities. The structure of a resource 
is defined by the resource definition + the client request (if the client is allowed
to load specific fields).</p>
<h2 id="resource-definition">Resource definition</h2>
<p>A resource definition is a contract with the outside world that defines how 
resources are created. A resource definition also defines how entities 
are to be transformed into resources.</p>
<h2 id="field">Field</h2>
<p>Resource definitions define fields that the resulting resource will contain. 
A field should be a simple data structure (string, number, date, ...).</p>
<h2 id="relationship">Relationship</h2>
<p>A relationship is a special type of field that defines a relationship between two 
resources. A relationship can have cardinality &quot;one&quot; or &quot;many&quot;. Relationships are,
by default, not &#39;extended&#39;, resulting in a relationship field being populated with 
a url (string) pointing to the related resource.</p>
<p>If, however, a relationship is extendable (= a user can choose to include the related 
resource) or extended (= the related resource is always included), the resource 
will be loaded on request and included in the output.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Charon requires a context to be set. The context defines the capabilities of the API (like 
how data can be received etc), but it can also contain variables that are required by 
entity getters. Entities could, for example, return data based on the currently authenticated 
user. This can be achieved by setting the user in the context and assigning the context.user 
variable to the entity getter.</p>
<h2 id="resolvers">Resolvers</h2>
<p>A resolver is in charge of loading data from entities or setting data into entities. 
For example, the included Laravel resolvers will use the Laravel magic getters to<br>load data from entities.</p>
<p>Data loaded from resolvers will then be set in the resources.</p>
<h2 id="entity-factory">Entity factory</h2>
<p>The entity factory is a special kind of resolver that loads entiteis based on identifiers. 
It allows Charon to load existing entities based on identifiers sent by the client.</p>
<h2 id="transformers">Transformers</h2>
<p>Each field in a resource definition can get a transformer assigned that is in 
charge of translating the raw value (fetched from the resolver) into a usable format.</p>
<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>
<p>A processor is called at various times during the Charon execution. It allows setting additional 
filters. An example is the included Pagination processor which adds cursor based pagination 
the an API.</p>
<h2 id="inputparser">InputParser</h2>
<p>The InputParsers take raw data from the http request and translate it to resources. 
These resources can then be validated and transformed into new or existing entities.</p>
<h2 id="linking-unlinking">Linking / Unlinking</h2>
<p>Linking and unlinking are imaginary http requests to link or unlink resources with 
eachother. A list of identifiers (most of the times this is the resource id) are sent 
in a <code>post</code> or <code>delete</code> request to add or remove related items.</p>
<h2 id="swagger">Swagger</h2>
<p>Swagger is THE WORLD&#39;S MOST POPULAR API FRAMEWORK. Not our words. 
<a href="http://www.swagger.io"><a href="http://www.swagger.io">http://www.swagger.io</a></a>. Charon will take all defined routes, 
resource definitions and input parameters and create swagger documentation on the fly.</p>
