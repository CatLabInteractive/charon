Charon Example
==============
In a normal situation, Charon needs to be extended with platform specific 'resolvers' that are used 
to load the correct data and parameters. In this example we provide a set of simple resolvers 
that mock the functionality that the framework would provide, with just enough functionality to 
get our example running.

Alternatively you can check out the example at the [Laravel implementation](https://github.com/CatLabInteractive/charon-laravel).
